# Description - A wireless ESP8266-based alert system for water tank overflow detection
## ðŸ’¡ Day 1 â€“ Idea 
I want to stop my water tank from overflowing. I'll use 2 ESP8266 boards: one on the tank (with a water sensor), and one inside my home (with a buzzer and LED). The communication will happen wirelessly using ESP-NOW.

## ðŸ§  Day 2 â€“ Planning
Got advice from Hack Club members. Made GitHub repo and started writing out my plan.
# Components and circuit Sketch
- 2 Ã— ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- 1 Ã— Water sensor (e.g., float sensor or capacitive)
- 1 Ã— Buzzer
- 1 Ã— LED
- Jumper wires, breadboard
- USB cable for programming
----- Uploaded a basic hand-drawn circuit showing how the ESPs communicate and where buzzer + water sensor connect.
