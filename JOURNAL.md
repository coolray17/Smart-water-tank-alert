# ðŸ““ Project Journal â€“ Smart Water Tank Overflow Alert

## ðŸ’¡ Day 1 â€“ Idea
I want to stop my water tank from overflowing. I'll use 2 ESP8266 boards: one on the tank (with a water sensor), and one inside my home (with a buzzer and LED). The communication will happen wirelessly using ESP-NOW.

## ðŸ§  Day 2 â€“ Planning
Got advice from Hack Club members. Decided not to make a PCB yet â€” just prototyping on breadboard. Made GitHub repo and started writing out my plan.

## ðŸ“¦ Day 3 â€“ Bill of Materials ,  Circuit Sketch
- 2 Ã— ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- 1 Ã— Water sensor (e.g., float sensor or capacitive)
- 1 Ã— Buzzer
- 1 Ã— LED
- Jumper wires, breadboard
- USB cable for programming
----- Uploaded a basic hand-drawn circuit showing how the ESPs communicate and where buzzer + water sensor connect.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Write Arduino code for ESP-NOW sender and receiver
- Test range and reliability
- Update with images and working video
